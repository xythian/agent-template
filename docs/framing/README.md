# Framing Documents

Framing documents capture product-level design, requirements, and the pitch for a project or feature. They describe *what* we're building and *why* from the product or application perspective, before work begins.

## When to Write a Framing Document

Write a framing document when:
- Starting a new project or significant product initiative
- Proposing a new user-facing feature or capability
- Defining requirements for a launch milestone
- The "what" and "why" need to be articulated before the "how"

Framing documents complement RFCs: a framing document captures the product vision and requirements, while an RFC proposes the technical approach to achieve it.

## What a Framing Document Covers

- **The pitch** - What are we building and why does it matter?
- **Requirements** - What must be true for this to be successful?
- **Scope** - What's in and what's out?
- **Success criteria** - How will we know it worked?

## File Naming

Use lowercase with hyphens and a descriptive name: `feature-name.md`

Examples:
- `user-onboarding.md`
- `v2-launch.md`
- `search-redesign.md`

## Lifecycle

Framing documents are living documents during the pre-launch phase. Once a feature or project launches, the framing document serves as a historical record of the original intent and requirements.
